In case you haven't seen this yet - as it was just released yesterday - a new trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is out.  I got chills watching it, remembering what went down in the last Harry Potter book.  The trailer, somewhat hyperbolically, states this is the "motion picture event of a generation" but really it kind of is.  I, along with many people around the world, grew up reading Harry Potter, waiting for the next book to be released and then rushing home to lock myself in until I finished reading it before it could be ruined.  Those were fun days.
