Stereogum Music Blog has posted their <a href="http://stereogum.com/582501/50-most-anticipated-albums-of-2011/franchises/listomania/" target="_blank">50 Most Anticipated Albums of 2011</a>.  It serves as a nice list of what's in store for 2011 and what music we have to listen forward to hearing.  Top of my list has me waiting for new The Avalanches, Fleet Foxes, M83, My Morning Jacket, Radiohead, and The Strokes album.  Just like every year, 2011 is shaping up to be a great year for music.  However in all honesty I am truly biting at the git for the new Avalanches album.  This has been way too long coming.
