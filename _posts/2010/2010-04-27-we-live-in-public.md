The format and structure of these reviews are bound to change like me - and hopefully for the better.

This past week I watched the documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0498329/">We Live in Public</a>.  Described (as of this writing) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Live_In_Public">on Wikipedia</a> as, “a 2009 documentary by Ondi Timoner about the loss of privacy in the Internet age, which focuses on Internet pioneer Josh Harris.”

This description is incredibly understated.

Josh Harris was one of the early dot-com pioneers, profiteers, and failures.  His company <a href="http://Pseudo.com">Pseudo.com</a> was one of the first video podcasts on the Internet.  It hosted a variety of internet shows with lively hosts and information, streamed for the enjoyment of anyone who logged on.

Did I mention this took place in 1994?

Harris’ grand vision of everyone filming and wanting to film themselves has proven to be far ahead of its time.  Today we have YouTube and a variety of other sites dedicated and thriving off of user-created content.  To be so prescient with this business plan was both Harris’ blessing and curse.

This film took me on a roller-coaster ride around and through emotions that I had never experienced sequentially.  The debate surrounding privacy is thoroughly investigated and the details of Harris’ exploits are boggling.

Clocking in at 90-minutes the film is direct and to the point.  There is no excess and Timoner lets the archived video speak for itself.

I’m extremely amazed and surprised that I did not know anything that was presented in this film, but I’m extremely grateful to have seen it.
