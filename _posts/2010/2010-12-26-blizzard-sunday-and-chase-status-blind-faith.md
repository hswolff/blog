What a wonderfully lazy Sunday.  I hope you're having fun lazing about like I am.  I'm up here in New England caught up in the first blizzard of the season and enjoying my movie marathon of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323594/">Despicable Me</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0963966/">The Sorcerer's Apprentice</a> (surprisingly highly enjoyable), and after dinner I believe <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0936501/">Taken</a> will round out the day.

While I wait for dinner I'm sitting here and listening to a new song from Chase & Status, titled 'Blind Faith'.  The album isn't out yet, and I'm listening to the song (on repeat) from a radio rip on YouTube.  Have a listen to it and let me know if it has you moving like me.
